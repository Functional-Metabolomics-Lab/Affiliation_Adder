**About**:
When working on a research paper with multiple collaborators, managing affiliations can become a tedious task. `AffilAdder` is a simple tool designed to help with this. Instead of manually inputting each author's affiliations into your paper, you can use this app to do it more efficiently.

**How to Use**:
1. Prepare an Excel sheet in '.xlsx' format. 
2. The sheet should have these columns: `Author`, `Affiliation1`, `Affiliation2`, and `Affiliation3`. Fill these columns with the appropriate details.
3. Upload the Excel sheet to the app.
4. The app will process the data and give you a '.txt' file. This file will have author names paired with their affiliations, ready for use in a research paper format.
5. Just copy the content from the '.txt' file and paste it into your research paper.

**Example Data**:
There's a sample Excel dataset provided within the app to guide you on the format. This can help you understand how the app processes the data and what the output looks like.

**Goal**:
The main aim is to save time and reduce the chances of manual errors.
